<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Water Baths Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Circulating Water Baths</li><li>Non-Circulating Water Baths</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory water baths are essential for maintaining stable temperatures in various scientific applications. The market is divided into two main types: circulating water baths and non-circulating water baths. Circulating water baths feature a pump that circulates water to ensure even temperature distribution, making them ideal for precise thermal control in experiments. Non-circulating water baths, on the other hand, maintain temperature but lack circulation, making them suitable for less demanding applications where uniform temperature is less critical.</p></p>
