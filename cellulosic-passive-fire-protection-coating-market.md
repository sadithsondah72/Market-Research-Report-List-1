<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulosic Passive Fire Protection Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based Coating</li><li>Solvent-Based Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cellulosic Passive Fire Protection Coating market encompasses two primary types: water-based coatings and solvent-based coatings. Water-based coatings utilize water as a primary solvent, offering low volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, easy cleanup, and reduced environmental impact. Solvent-based coatings, on the other hand, use organic solvents, providing superior adhesion and durability but typically have higher VOC levels. Both types aim to enhance fire resistance in structures by forming a protective layer that slows heat transfer and prevents combustion.</p></p>
